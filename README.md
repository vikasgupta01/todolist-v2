# todolist-v2

todolist-v1 (for more visit : https://github.com/vikasgupta01/todolist-v1)
This project uses old code from todolist-v1, and integrates a NoSQL database setup for data persistence (so that the list contents don't get reset after each session).

Tools and Technologies Used : 
1. Node.js-Express.js for backend.
2. MongoDB-Mongoose for data persistence.
3. EJS for views.
4. Lodash for proper routing without worrying about letter-cases.


The project is deployed on heroku and you can visit it at : https://todolist-vikas.herokuapp.com/

Add the custom listname at the end to create a task specific new todolist.
